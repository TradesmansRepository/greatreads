A personal project to build a book sharing app whilst becoming familar with Django. Very much a work in progress.

Started with relatively little idea of direction other than having a rough idea to create a web app for users to search, like and share books.

Problems I have encountered so far have included:
1. deciding whether to write an API via DjangoREST framework or to utilise the templating features built into Django. I initially started creating this as an API with a view to learning the basics of the REST framework which was successful but have since pivoted to utilise the templates. I began using Bootstrap css but have also decided to pivot from that to start using Tailwind.

2. Data. I wanted to have lots of data but didn't want to create it manually. I was able to download a bulk of data online which involved quite a bit of manual cleansing and shaping to be able to upload to the app via the database.
